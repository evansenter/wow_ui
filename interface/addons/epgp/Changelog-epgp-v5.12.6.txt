v5.12.6 - Bug fix release


--------------------

Brizag:
	- [Bug fix] Sometimes wrong region (US/EU/...) was specified on data export
	Use LibRealmInfo instead of GetCVar("portal") which is unreliable to determine the current region.
	- [Bug fix] Legion socketed items were not accounted for additional GP.
	- Use short names in the UI for non-cross realm characters
	- Refactored common code
	New functions GetFullCharacterName()/GetDisplayCharacterName() for nickname manipulation. It is used in several places.
