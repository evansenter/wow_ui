Tag as v4.1.5


--------------------

Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Add a smart hostfile/friendly aura filter
	- Use RegisterUnitEvent for UNIT_AURA
	- Added a new option to change the color of the healthbar if the unit has a curable debuff
	- Update power statusbar and tags after repopping at a spirit healer
	This uses the deprecated UNIT_MANA event, since its the only one that
	actually fires in that instance and seems vaguely related.
	- incheal: fix framelevel in a few cases and simplify frame level handling
	- incheal: Always check the maxHealth and bail out early if its not set
	- Remove more remnants of obsolete power types
