Infus:
	- Rewrite Ignore Rune CD
	Apparently a spell cd due to a rune has always a duration of 10.
	So, rewrite the ignore rune cd option to use that fact. And track
	the spell cooldowns but disregard any update that has a duration of
	10 for those spells.
	- Fix remaining time check for some auras
	Ticket-number: 68
	- Fix sorting in dynamic groups
	We need to set the duration information in the region before we
	call expand, as expand will call controlChildren, which sorts
	according to the duration info.
	
	Ticket-number: 156
Steffen Buehl:
	- change dungeon difficulty load condition from select to multiselect
