    Fix cooldown still showing on icons after closing options window

    Fix SetDurationInfo with a 0 duration
    
    The old code was a bit confussing. It first called SetValue(1),
    but overrode this immediately by a call to SetValue(0).

    Rewrite circular progress using the new SetVertexOffset api in wow 7.2
    
    This allows for arbitary start/end angles and should fix occasional
    gaps being visible for circular progress.

    Add "Hide Cooldown Text" option
    
    Which hides the blizzard text on cooldowns. (Which is enabled
    via "Show Numbers for Cooldowns".
    
    If the user has OmniCC installed, don't show the option. As
    the option would not hide OmniCC's text.
    
    But call SetHideCountdownNumbers(true) if omnicc is installed,
    as that prevents double text from appearing.
    
    Technically, users could disable OmniCC's text and enable the
    Blizzard text, but that seems a remote use case.

    Fix formatting of progress and total values for Text auras
    
    The icon/aurabar and text auras have almost indentical code to handle
    SetDurationInfo. Except that the text aura was missing some code
    to handle some formats missing.
    
    Remove all that code duplication.
    
    If auras provide SetValue,SetTime and TimerTick they get a generic
    SetDurationInfo that handles 90% of the work.
    
    With this it's also much easier to add text support to more region
    types.

    Conditions: Fix check for active == false
    
    Two separate bugs actually:
    1) All checks started by checking for state and state.variable.
    But that doesn't work if state.variable is false, thus change that
    to state.variable ~= nil. And while doing that, remove the code
    duplication for that.
    
    2) If state doesn't exist, the code so far made the condition always
    return false. But, that's incorrect for show. Make those conditions
    that provide their own test also check for state. Add a new
    condition test to the active condition.

    Add comments to error messages (#182)
    
    make LoadFunction() accept two additional parameters that can be added to the error message to better identify the auras that are causing errors. For now we only pass in the id to LoadFunction in every custom function so we get the name up in there.
