	- Omega via svn r12357: Change bunch of move warnings to new "dodge" warning. big difference between dodging an attack, and moving from shit on ground, warning clarity important. Fixed bug where dispel warning was firing for classes that can't dispel poisons on kyrak
	- Omega via svn r12356: Fix bug
	- Omega via svn r12355: bw version
	- nbluewiz via svn r12354: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12353: comment this out for now. sometimes boss mcs on 1, 3, 5 7, sometimes 2, 4, 6, 8. need to find cause of this. need to see if maybe ballsforgot needs +1. did not video so can't see if ballsforgot is cause of this.
	- Omega via svn r12352: Give frost target, because we can. Although no special warnings because it really doesn't matter much. if you are close to this person it's going to hit you and you can do nothing about you. only has initial damage so warning near you not help you avoid any damage or danger.
	- Omega via svn r12351: Spam reduce. very common on mythic for soaker jump in and out of barrier to get heals.
	- Omega via svn r12350: delay fel yell more
	- nbluewiz via svn r12349: # revert
	- nbluewiz via svn r12348: # typo
	- nbluewiz via svn r12347: # fix bug.
	- Omega via svn r12346: disable broken warnings
	- Omega via svn r12345: Start fortified yell one yell earlier, to help get it to correct hunter/druid, etc sooner.
	- Omega via svn r12344: Add Accelerated Assault.
	- Omega via svn r12343: fix maybe
	- Omega via svn r12342: speed up icon
	- Omega via svn r12341: dont print own whisper
	- Omega via svn r12340: Fix icon option
	- Omega via svn r12339: Fix impossible lua error. literally impossible, but it's happening some fucking how
	- Omega via svn r12338: missed that version
	- Omega via svn r12337: Support banned mods in voice packs too, to prevent loading double voice packs (example, KiwiBeta vs Kiwi).
	- Omega via svn r12336: Add icon option for crystal barrage for phase 1 and 2 (tectus, and shards). disabled in phase 3 because motes can be messy, especially if their timers get out of sync then very very messy. Icons on motes more useful in phase 3 anyways since too many barrages at once in many diff directions.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12335: # fix gtfo.
	- Omega via svn r12334: Request
	- Omega via svn r12333: Improve margok status whisper to not say 2 bosses on non mythic
	- Omega via svn r12332: Add scatter to force nova replication voice
	- Omega via svn r12331: Added fire bar too. it's more variable than rest, but still acceptable to have timer for. As long as people comprehend that CD means variable. 60-66 variation here.
	- tandanu via svn r12330: increment alpha version
