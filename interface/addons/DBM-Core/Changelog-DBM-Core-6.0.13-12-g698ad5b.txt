subversion:
	- Omega via svn r12555: cache LastInstanceType so we don't needlessly request GetInstanceInfo() nearly as much (especially checkwipe function) Disable update notification in pvp, mainly because it's not important to up to date there. Not because someone asked. Only important to for actual raids.
	- Omega via svn r12554: Better
	- Omega via svn r12553: Fix bug where blat icon would keep removing/adding over and over again.
	- Omega via svn r12552: use combined for slow as well
	- Omega via svn r12551: use combined show for specWarnBrandedDisplacementNear
	- nbluewiz via svn r12550: # combined show for special warning.
	- Omega via svn r12549: Remove /help from help menu. add /range instead. Telling you how to get to help menu, in the help menu, not useful. Documenting how to use range frame is a bit more useful.
	- Omega via svn r12548: Support reverse range.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12547: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12546: Bump BW version
	- tandanu via svn r12545: create default profile if you somehow lost it
	- tandanu via svn r12544: increment alpha verison
