	- Omega via svn r15094: Update remove curse warnings to now be off by default for mages
	- Omega via svn r15093: Remove enable/disable checkbox. it only leads to more confusion. if you want to disable dbm you should do it via addon manager. doesn?\226?\128?\153t make much sense to enable a mod only to uncheck ?\226?\128?\156enabled?\226?\128?\157 in the mod and have it still not work. This should also clean up and improve the force disable function. Users should only be required to update mod after a force disable. not update mod then go into options and check ?\226?\128?\156enabled?\226?\128?\157 on top of it. Experience is supposed to be smooth not stupid.
