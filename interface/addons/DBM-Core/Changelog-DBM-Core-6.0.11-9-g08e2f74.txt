subversion:
	- Omega via svn r12338: missed that version
	- Omega via svn r12337: Support banned mods in voice packs too, to prevent loading double voice packs (example, KiwiBeta vs Kiwi).
	- Omega via svn r12336: Add icon option for crystal barrage for phase 1 and 2 (tectus, and shards). disabled in phase 3 because motes can be messy, especially if their timers get out of sync then very very messy. Icons on motes more useful in phase 3 anyways since too many barrages at once in many diff directions.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12335: # fix gtfo.
	- Omega via svn r12334: Request
	- Omega via svn r12333: Improve margok status whisper to not say 2 bosses on non mythic
	- Omega via svn r12332: Add scatter to force nova replication voice
	- Omega via svn r12331: Added fire bar too. it's more variable than rest, but still acceptable to have timer for. As long as people comprehend that CD means variable. 60-66 variation here.
	- tandanu via svn r12330: increment alpha version
