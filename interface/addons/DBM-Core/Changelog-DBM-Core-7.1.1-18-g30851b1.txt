	- ultrashining via svn r15436: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r15435: Update hash
	- Omega via svn r15434: Push the 7.1 restriction reminder again. at least once a day someone is opening a ticket about radar/hud/arrow not working in instances. Fixed defiled spirit warning/timer not working beyond pull timer.
	- Omega via svn r15433: This should probably fix issues with Mythic+ Timer not hiding. I realize now what?\226?\128?\153s happening is players already have a mod hiding objectives frame or replacing it, so frame is already returning false for visible, but dbm only canceled mythic+ if DBM is the mod that was hiding watch frame. This change should solve that, hopefully

	- Omega via svn r15427: Bump a few more HF revisions so people with really out of date mods start getting more nags
	- Omega via svn r15426: set HF
	- Omega via svn r15425: Forgot to register UNIT_DIED
	- Omega via svn r15424: Add nightbane warnings/timers. This should cover all the important stuff. minor tweaks will come later.

	- Omega via svn r15422: Make the improved behavior new default, but keep it optional in case people preferred it other way
	- Omega via svn r15421: Check debuff time on ilgyoth and warn to taunt earlier if it?\226?\128?\153ll fall off before next cast. Add timer correction when horror is delayed by flowers. Remove some redundancy in core
